# About
I wrote Maze 2.0 back in Elementary School in 2012 after programming Maze 1.0. Using everything that I had learned from experimenting with command prompt, I wanted this to be my best game of all time. I poured tons of features into the game, everything from animated Ascii cutscenes, 2 boss battles, and the ability to save your game. Overall, this is probably my best batch game ever!

_Note: For this game to work, you must have choice.exe installed on your Windows machine_
